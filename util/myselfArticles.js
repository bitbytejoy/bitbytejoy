That is why it's even more important to stay updated on newest technologies and to possess the knowledge that gives my clients shorter development cycles with clean code bases and simple user friendly designs."

These problems are usually caused by the technologies they choose to work with. It has happened, more often than I expected, that I client asked for a specific technology, just because someone told him that is the technology to be used. Sometimes it was the right technology and sometimes it was not."

I have then worked on many smaller and medium sized projects also. I have used Java Spring, Ruby on Rails, Node.js Express, PHP Laravel, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, React, Angular, Sass, Less, Java Spark, Play Framework, Haskell, C, C++, and many others I cannot even remember. I have worked with companies in different sectors, from telecomunications to social media. I have had the opportunity to shape the technological futures of companies.",

After the end of every project I have worked on, I have evaluated the mistakes made on those projects and tried to figure out the best approach for the next one.",
      "All my experience has thought me a thing or two. I have become a biased developer with strong opinions on technologies. Some technologies I don't consider worthy of working on anymore and won't accept a job for. The reason for this is that I have seen what those technologies do to projects and how much the technologies prolongate something that could have been done a lot easier and faster with more happy customers and even more satisfied developers.",
